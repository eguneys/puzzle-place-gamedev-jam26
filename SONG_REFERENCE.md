(Intro - 4 bars)

Acoustic Guitar: Gently xstrums a C major chord for 4 beats, then a G major chord for 4 beats. Repeat once.
| C / / / | G / / / | C / / / | G / / / |
(Verse 1 - 8 bars)

Acoustic Guitar: Plays the following chord progression (one chord per 4 beats):
| C / / / | F / / / | G / / / | C / / / |
| C / / / | F / / / | G / / / | C / / / |
Flute (Lead Melody - simple, flowing):
(Plays notes roughly like): C E G G | F E D C | G A G E | C - - - |
(Repeats similarly): E G A G | F E D C | G A B G | C - - - |
(Think: Gentle morning light, simple melody mainly using notes C, E, G, F)
(Chorus - 8 bars)

Acoustic Guitar: Changes progression slightly (one chord per 4 beats):
| Am / / / | G / / / | C / / / | F / / / |
| Am / / / | G / / / | C / / / | G / / / | (Ending on G leads back to C or Am better)
Flute (Lead Melody - maybe slightly more movement):
(Plays notes roughly like): A C E E | G B G E | C D E F | E D C - |
(Repeats similarly): A C E E | G B G E | C D E G | G F E - |
(Think: A slightly more thoughtful or flowing feeling, using notes like A, C, E but still within the key)
(Verse 2 - 8 bars)

Acoustic Guitar: Same as Verse 1:
| C / / / | F / / / | G / / / | C / / / |
| C / / / | F / / / | G / / / | C / / / |
Flute (Lead Melody): Similar to Verse 1, perhaps with small variations to keep it interesting.
(Think: Returning to the calm morning feel)
(Chorus - 8 bars)

Acoustic Guitar: Same as the first Chorus:
| Am / / / | G / / / | C / / / | F / / / |
| Am / / / | G / / / | C / / / | G / / / |
Flute (Lead Melody): Same as the first Chorus.
(Think: Repeating the core reflective theme)
(Outro - 4 bars)

Acoustic Guitar: Strums C major chord slowly, letting it ring, perhaps ending with a gentle arpeggio (playing C-G-C notes one after another).
| C / / / | C / / / | C / / / | C (hold) |
Flute: Plays a simple, slow descending line like G... E... C... holding the final C note until it fades out with the guitar.
